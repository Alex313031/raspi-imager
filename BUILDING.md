#### Building a .deb package

```bash
cd raspi-imager
debuild -uc -us
```

debuild will compile everything, create a .deb package and put it in the parent directory.
Then you can install it with dpkg:

```bash
cd ..
sudo dpkg --install ./raspi-imager*.deb
```

It should create an icon in the start menu under "Utilities" or "Accessories".
The imaging utility will normally be run as regular user, and will call udisks2 over DBus to perform privileged operations like opening the disk device for writing.
If udisks2 is not functional on your Linux distribution, you can alternatively start it as "root" with sudo or gksudo and similar tools.

#### Building on the Pi

If building on a device with limited memory (e.g. 1 GB RAM Pi), disable parallel build or it may run out of memory.
Export this before running the build script:

```bash
export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="parallel=1"
```

### Fedora/RHEL/CentOS Linux

#### Get dependencies

Install the build dependencies:

```bash
sudo yum install git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake libarchive-devel libcurl-devel openssl-devel qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtquickcontrols2-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-linguist
```

#### Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex313031/raspi-imager
```

#### Build and install the software

```bash
cd raspi-imager
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ../src
make
sudo make install
```

### Windows

#### Get dependencies

- Get the Qt online installer from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
During installation, choose a Qt 5.x with Mingw32 32-bit toolchain and CMake.

- If using the official Qt distribution that does NOT have schannel (Windows native SSL library) support, compile OpenSSL libraries ( https://wiki.qt.io/Compiling_OpenSSL_with_MinGW ) and copy the libssl/crypto DLLs to C:\qt\5.x\mingw73_32\bin  the include files to C:\qt\5.x\mingw73_32\include and the import library files to C:\qt\5.x\mingw73_32\lib

- For building installer get Nullsoft scriptable install system: https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

- It is assumed you already have a proper code signing certificate, and signtool.exe from the Windows SDK installed.
If NOT and are you only compiling for your own personal use, comment out all lines mentioning signtool from CMakelists.txt and the .nsi installer script.

#### Building

Building can be done manually using the command-line, using "cmake", "make", etc., but if you are not that familar with setting up a proper Windows build environment (setting paths, etc.), it is easiest to use the Qt creator GUI instead.

- Download source .zip from github and extract it to a folder on disk
- Open src/CMakeLists.txt in Qt creator.
- For builds you distribute to others, make sure you choose "Release" in the toolchain settings and not the debug flavour.
- Menu "Build" -> "Build all"
- Result will be in build_rpi-imager_someversion
- Go to the BUILD folder, right click on the .nsi script "Compile NSIS script", to create installer.

Note: the CMake integration in Qt Creator is a bit flaky at times. If you made any custom changes to the CMakeLists.txt file and it subsequently gets in an endless loop where it never finishes the "configures" stage while re-processing the file, delete "build_rpi-imager_someversion" directory and try again.

### Mac OS X

#### Get dependencies

- Get the Qt online installer from: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source
During installation, choose a Qt 5.x edition and CMake.
- For creating a .DMG for distribution you can use an utility like: https://github.com/sindresorhus/create-dmg
- It is assumed you have an Apple developer subscription, and already have a "Developer ID" code signing certificate for distribution outside the Mac Store. (Privileged apps are not allowed in the Mac store)

#### Building

- Download source .zip from github and extract it to a folder on disk
- Start Qt Creator (may need to start "finder" navigate to home folder using the "Go" menu, and find Qt folder to start it manually as it may not have created icon in Applications), and open src/CMakeLists.txt
- Menu "Build" -> "Build all"
- Result will be in build_rpi-imager_someversion
- For distribution to others: code sign the .app, create a DMG, code sign the DMG, submit it for notarization to Apple and staple the notarization ticket to the DMG.

E.g.:

```bash
cd build-rpi-imager-Desktop_Qt_5_14_1_clang_64bit-Release/
codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose --sign "YOUR KEYID" --options runtime raspi-imager.app
mv raspi-imager.app raspi-imager.app
create-dmg raspi-imager.app
xcrun altool --notarize-app -t osx -f imager.dmg --primary-bundle-id="org.raspberrypi.imagingutility" -u YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS -p YOUR-APP-SPECIFIC-APPLE-PASSWORD -itc_provider TEAM-ID-IF-APPLICABLE
xcrun stapler staple raspi-imager.dmg
```

### Linux embedded (netboot) build

The embedded build runs under a minimalistic Linux distribution compiled by buildroot.
To build:

- You must be running a Linux system, and have the buildroot dependencies installed as listed in the buildroot manual: https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#requirement
- Run:

```bash
cd raspi-imager/embedded
./build.sh
```

The result will be in the "output" directory.
The files can be copied to a FAT32 formatted SD card, and inserted in a Pi for testing.
If you would like to build a (signed) netboot image there are tools for that at: https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/tree/master/tools
